**HR Analytics Dashboard for Staff Retention Using Power BI**
As part of a strategic initiative to address staff retention challenges, I spearheaded the development of an HR Analytics dashboard utilizing Power BI. The primary objective was to create a comprehensive, data-driven tool that could provide actionable insights into employee retention and turnover trends.
**Project Overview:**
•	**Identifying Key Indicators:** The project began with a thorough analysis of various employee-related data points. Critical indicators such as employee tenure, job satisfaction scores, performance ratings, and engagement survey results were identified as key factors influencing retention. I collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure these indicators were accurately captured and regularly updated in the system.
**•	Data Integration and Modeling:** Leveraging Power BI's robust data integration capabilities, I connected multiple data sources, including HRIS, employee surveys, and performance management systems. I designed and implemented data models that allowed for the seamless aggregation of these diverse data sets into a unified platform.
**•	Dashboard Design and Development:** The dashboard was designed with user-friendliness in mind, allowing HR professionals and leadership to easily navigate through various visualizations. It featured interactive charts, graphs, and KPIs that highlighted trends in turnover rates, identified at-risk employees, and pinpointed departments or teams with higher attrition. Filters and drill-down functionalities were incorporated to allow users to explore data at different levels of granularity.
**•	Data-Driven Decision Making:** The dashboard enabled HR leaders to shift from reactive to proactive strategies by providing real-time insights into retention drivers. For example, it allowed the identification of patterns such as higher turnover in specific roles or demographic groups. These insights facilitated targeted interventions such as tailored training programs, improved onboarding processes, and enhanced employee engagement initiatives.
**Results:**
The implementation of the HR Analytics dashboard resulted in a significant improvement in staff retention rates. By leveraging data-driven insights, the organization was able to reduce voluntary turnover ..
